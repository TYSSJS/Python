Inheritance --> Inheritance is the process of acquiring all the members of super class to sub class accept the private members.
 --> There are five levels of inheritance--
 1. Single level inheritance -->
    When a single class is extending to a single super class

 2. MultiLevel Inheritance -->
    When a sub class is extending to the super class, and that super class is again extending to the another super type.

 3. Hierarchical Inheritance -->
    When a super class is extended by more than one sub class.

 4. Multiple Inheritance -->
    When a sub class is extended by multiple super class.

 5. Hybrid Inheritance -->
    It is the combination of multiple inheritance and the hierarchical inheritance.
