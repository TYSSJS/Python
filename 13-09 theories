1. LIST:
 A list is a data structure that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements.
 We can insert, remove items.
 We can defined the list inside []
 Ex : list=[12,'hi',98.8,1,2]

 2. SET:
 Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements.
 we can declare set by {}
 we can perform difference,clear
 Ex : set={1, 4, 6, 9}

 3. TUPLE:
 A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists.
 The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists.
 Tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.
 Ex : t=('ibm', 'tyss', 97, 2)

 4. DICTIONARY:
 Dictionary is a set of key and value pair where keys should unique and values can be duplicate.
 A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed.
 In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets.
 Ex : d={1:'hi', 2:'bey'}

 5. CLASS:
 A class is a code template for creating objects.
 In python a class is created by the keyword class .
 Ex: class Fruit:
           pass
orange = Fruit()
print(orange)

 6. OBJECT:
 object is a real time existence which has some property and behaviour.
 And also we can tell instance of class
 class pen():
    brand = 'camblin'
    def smell(self):
        print("smells good")
object=pen()

 7. CONSTRUCTOR
 A constructor is a special kind of method that Python calls when it instantiates an object using the definitions found in your class.
 Python relies on the constructor to perform tasks such as initializing (assigning values to) any instance variables that
 the object will need when it starts.
 The constructor can accept arguments when necessary to create the object.
 When you create a class without a constructor, Python automatically creates a default constructor.

 Ex: class MyClass:
 Greeting=''
 def __init__(self, Name="hi"):
  self.Greeting = Name + "!"
 def SayHello(self):
  print("Hello")

  8. METHOD:
   A method is a function that takes a class instance as its first parameter.
   Methods are members of classes.
   Its a block of code to perform some particular task.
   Ex: def m1():
         print("hello")
       m1()
   We have 4 types of methods:
   1. no return type, no parameter
   2. no return type with parameter
   3. Return type with no parameter
   4. Return type with parameter
