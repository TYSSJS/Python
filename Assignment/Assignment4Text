List:-
List is a collection of data,which can be of both heterogeneous and homogeneous type.
Features of list:-
* Indexed
*Allow duplicates
*Implements growable data structures
*Supports both positive and negative indexing
*Follows order of insertion

Set:-
Set is a collection of data,which can be of both heterogeneous and homogeneous type.
Features of Set:-

*Mutable in nature

Tuple:-
Tuple is a collection of data,which can be of both heterogeneous and homogeneous type.
Features of Tuple:-
*Allow duplicates
*Indexed
*Immutable
*Implements non-growable data structures

Dictionary:-
Dictionary is a Key value pair. Key-Values are seperated by colon& the pairs are seperated by comma.
Key must be unique, whereas values can be duplicates
The entire Dictionaryis enclosed within curly braces
We can get only keys using keys method and values using values method.
We can fetch values using specific key.

#12. Define class,object and constructor.
Class:-
