Class:
A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them.
In python a class is created by the keyword class . An object is created using the constructor of the class. This
object will then be called the instance of the class

ex:
class employee:
    //state
    name
    id
    //behaviour
    def working():
    {

    }

Obect:
    real time entity we can call it as object. It has state and behviour; to access any members of a class an object must
    be created.
    ex: for the above class
    o=employee()
