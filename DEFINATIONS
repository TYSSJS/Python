# 11-write the definations of-list,set,tuple
LIST:-
-in python list is a data structure
-list is the collection of values which is declared within []
-The values in list may be homogeneous or heterogeneous
-list is growable in nature i.e its changable and mutable
-it allows the insertion order , so list is indexed
-it can be sorted
eg:- l=[2,"hi",587,25.63,'hello',20,'a']

SET:-
-set is the collection of heterogeneous which is declared within {}
- set does not allow duplicate values
-set doesn't allow insertion order so its not indexed
-here we have to perform (union, intersection, difference) operations for iteration
eg:- s={"abc",45,'f',25.47,78}

TUPLE:-
-set in python same as list but tuple is not growable
-tuple is represented by ()
eg:- t=("abc",25,78.98,'a',10)

# 12-define class,object,method,constuctor
CLASS:-
-class is a template or blue print which used to create object
-class is created by using keyword "class"
syntax:   class className:

OBJECT:-
-object is the instance or physical existence of a class which describes the properties and behaviours
-object is created by using class constructor in python
-Multiple object may be created for a particular class but address of each object is different
syntax: objectName=className()

METHOD:-
-methods are the function in a class used to perform a particular action or task
-methods may be inbuilt or user defined
-it may have return type and argument depending upon the usage of the user
syntax:- def methodName():

CONSTRUCTOR:-
-Constructor is a function present in class which having same name as the class
-it is used to initialise values for the object during object creation
-Without constructor object can"t be created
syntax:- className()
        -objectName=className()
